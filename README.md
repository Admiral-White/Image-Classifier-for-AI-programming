# Image-Classifier-for-AI-programming (This project is from AI programming with Python Nanodegree at Udacity)
Using Deep learning to classify dog breed based on the images provided.
This project is a dog classifier using three model architetures (resnet, alexnet and vgg).

Use the following commands to run the application:

python check_images.py --dir pet_images/
python check_images.py --dir uploaded_images/ 
sh run_models_batch.sh   (run batch models with default folder [pet_image])
sh run_models_batch_uploaded.sh    (run batch models with uploaded folder [uploaded_images])

python check_images.py (will run with the default parameters and use default folder [pet_images])
